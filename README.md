# jee-jboss-playground
This project has a number or sub-modules, each of which contains a Java EE technology example.
It runs on a docker jboss/wildfly container.

See the README.txt in each sub-module for further details.

Run each sub-module individually. The parent pom.xml is a configuration pom and allows the entire repository to be imported to the IDE as a single 
project for convenience.
